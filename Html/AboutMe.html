            <p>A boy who started with curiosity and love for computers, now a student
                 learning to code, breaking loops of procrastination one at a time.
                  This is the story of my life, full of bugs, fixes, and unexpected outputs. 
                  My Name is Jophet Villamor Sanchez, Currently living in Pardo, Cebu. 
                  I'm 19 Years old, born in July 30, 2005. I have quite big family, 
                  I have 4 brothers. My Mother is a OFW and My Father is a Mechanic. 
                  When I was a child I'm always curious in everything including computers, 
                  always seeking information about anything. Since I was a child 
                  I only have one promise on my self until now and it is to have a 
                  simple family, be financially stable, and marry a beautifull wife 
                  because I believe that my future childrens will thank me because they 
                  have good traits inherited because of my hardwork and being naturally
                   handsome and intelligent. In the present, I'm currently a 2nd year 
                   student at the Cebu Technological University studying Bachelor of Science 
                   in Information System. As I always mention I'm in a loop between being 
                   genius and procrastinator but that's alright. because, I always look
                   forward for the future. I have made a few genuine friends and they are 
                   actually one of the reasons that I'm motivated to finish my course. 
                   So, I'm thankfull for them. My Hobbies in the present are coding, 
                   gaming, music, being handsome and goodlooking. I hope in the future 
                   that I will be able to say to myself that I'm proud of what you achieve 
                   after all the struggles you have faced you're still handsome. </p>
